# Newb Pineapple

**Newb Pineapple** is a RenderDragon successor to the legacy GLSL shader, [Newb Shader](https://github.com/devendrn/newb-shader-mcbe). It is an enhanced vanilla shader that focuses on being lightweight and having soft aesthetics. It supports Minecraft Bedrock 1.21+ (Windows/Android/iOS).

> [!WARNING]
> This is an experimental repository, breaking changes are made often.

## Building

### Install dependencies
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.11 or higher required
- Python packages:
  - [lazurite](https://veka0.github.io/lazurite/#installation) (Must be `v0.4.2`. Newer or older version may not be supported)
  - [rich](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction.html#installation) (Must be `v13.x.x`)

### Get source code
```
git clone https://github.com/devendrn/newb-x-mcbe/
cd newb-x-mcbe
```

### Install dependencies from requirements.txt
*Skip if you already have installed those versions.*
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Setup build environment
> [!NOTE]
> On Windows, run `.\build.bat` instead of `./build.sh` for all following commands.
```
./build.sh setup
```
This will download shaderc binary and material data required to build shader.

<br>

### Compile specific shader materials
```
./build.sh mats
```
Compiled material.bin files will be inside `build/<platform>/`

**Command usage:**
```
usage: build mats [-h] [-p {android,windows,merged,ios}] [-m M [M ...]] [-s S]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p {android,windows,merged,ios}
                        build profile
  -m M [M ...]          build materials (eg: Sky)
  -s S                  subpack config to use (eg: NO_WAVE)
```

### Compile and build full shader pack
```
./build.sh pack
```

The final mcpack will be inside `build/`.

**Command usage:**
```
usage: build pack [-h] [-p {android,windows,merged,ios}] [--no-zip] [--no-label] [-v V]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p {android,windows,merged,ios}
                        build profile
  --no-zip              don't make archive
  --no-label            don't label materials
  -v V                  version number eg: 17
```

> [!TIP]
> If you want to customize pack name, author, version and other details, you can do so in `src/newb/pack_config.toml`.
